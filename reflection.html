        <p> &emsp;Responsive design means a design that can build a website optimized for all screens with one source code. In the past, most computers were used to access Internet websites. However, with the development of technology, various smart devices such as smart device (smartphones, pads, and tabs) have emerged, and existing web sites focused on desktops are not suitable for small screens. Therefore, it is necessary to have a technology that automatically fits the web page to the user's screen size. Even if it is the same page, it is inconvenient to create different types of pages depending on which device we are accessing. It is the responsive design that has emerged in this kind of trouble. When using a responsive web, the page source is one, but the resolution and layout of the page change flexibly for the connected device. Numerous types of smartphones have different screen sizes. Despite this, it is because of the role of responsive design that all devices can access and view web pages without difficulty. As such, the responsive design provides an environment for viewing the optimal web page from any device. It is an important technology that is indispensable in an era where not only computers but also many kinds of smart devices are prevalent. With this technology, we don't have to create a suitable web page for each device, but only one public website with the same URL address. So we don't have to create both a pc version of the website and a mobile version of the website, which cuts costs, time and manpower in half. We can also manage web pages efficiently. For example, if the content of a web page needs to be modified, even if only one page is modified, it can be reflected in various devices. And it is advantageous for search engine optimization. Since mobile pages and desktop pages are not separated, they can be more exposed to search engines. </p>
        <br>
        <p> &emsp;There are three core technologies used in responsive web design.</p>
        <p> &emsp;1. Fluid grid: Fluid grid is a technique that optimizes resolution using a flexible layout. Normally, when creating a website for a desktop, the size of a box or picture is set to px, which specifies the absolute size of the figure. The fluid grid, which is a technique that allows a web page to be freely stretched or reduced according to the width of the browser without specifying a specific width or margin, uses%. That is, what percentage of the layout is occupied by the screen.</p>
        <p> &emsp;2. Flexible Images: In the past, when using images, width and heigh values were set to fixed values such as px, but it is a technique that approaches the concept of percentage rather than a method of putting fixed values. This is a technique in which the width value of the area where the image is entered is automatically calculated and the image size is scaled.</p>
        <p> &emsp;3. Media Queries: is used to print web pages for each situation. It can be set by the operator depending on the resolution of the output device, scan method, whether to print, and whether the device is vertical or horizontal. In the end, it is a technique that can be optimized for various situations by differently processing css according to how it is output.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&emsp;I used the above three techniques to make the web page of assignment 5 on mobile. The unit of layout and image were changed from px to %. Also, web page was designed to list three products in a row, but I modified to show one product in a row on the mobile size. During this assignment, I think I was able to think a lot about how to make other people view my webpage more conveniently and well. Also, at first, I thought it would be difficult to see only the subject. However, when I ended up modifying it for many hours, I could learn another skill, so it was very valuable to me.</p>
